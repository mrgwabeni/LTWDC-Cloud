<h1>ABOUT THIS COURSE</h1>

Successful sales managers need to master compelling sales techniques and leadership skills to lead the way with a competitive strategy. On the course, students will learn to implement management best practices to benefit their business. From forecasting and budgets to recruitment and performance evaluation, this University of Cape Town (UCT) Sales Management online short course covers a broad range of skills designed to equip effective sales managers.

​

“I learned a lot of methods that I have always doubted, and now I am more confident in what I am executing in my sales career. It also boosts confidence when networking with the classmates and realising your topic has some valid points and useful aspects to others. It gives you a clear insight into what is happening in the industry, with up-to-date communication and articles I never thought I'd be exposed to.”
